# Seat Planner

![visual-basic](https://github.com/tc-ying/Queens-College/blob/main/Seat-Planner/docs/ui-teaser.jpg)

This is a naive applet to group guests into tables in a banquet. At least, similar age groups are grouped together and sex ratio of each table is balanced out. In essence, it is a nested sort written in VB.

The algorithm failed if guests are too many. But it was a high school project. Bug was pardoned.
