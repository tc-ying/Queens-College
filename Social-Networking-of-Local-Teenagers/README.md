# Xanga : Social Networking for Local Teenager

As a teen in 2008, I was puzzled by other teens' fuss about [Xanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanga) — Facebook of the day. But:

 1. Xanga was designed as a closed and furtive ecosystem. Less media invasion. More original content. How people connected differently?
 2. The platform was **only** popular in Hong Kong. Did it say something about the culture?

## How people act. What people need.

I collected numbers and stalked some blogs. For example, most Xangas connected with below 20 Friends — sounds ridiculous today.

There was also more one-to-one chit-chats. But behaviours were more or less the same as in 2010s. Perhaps *business-like* connection is more logical than intimacy on the Internet. Or because running friendships like media is by definition more contagious and overwhelming. Xanga brands itself as a diary space thus sounds phoney. Facebook is simply more candid with people's need.
